**Open source AI video platform** to create viral Shorts, Reels & TikTok clips with smart reframing, auto subtitles with custom typography (`Barlow-ExtraLight`), AI UGC shorts with talking avatars, and YouTube studio tools.

![Your podcast, and the vertical clip OpenShorts makes of it: both speakers stacked, captions on the seam](screenshots/split-before-after.gif)

Two people on camera? OpenShorts stacks them instead of shrinking the wide shot, puts the captions on the seam where they cover nobody, and switches back to a face-tracked crop when the cut goes to one person. The AI picks the layout per video; nothing to configure.

**Two ways to run it, same software either way:**

|  | Self-hosted (this repo) | Hosted on [openshorts.app](https://www.openshorts.app/) |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Free forever, MIT | Free plan, paid from $12/mo |
| **Speed** | 5 to 8 min per 8-min video on CPU | About 50s on our NVIDIA GPU |
| **API keys** | Bring your own Gemini, ElevenLabs, fal.ai | Gemini included, nothing to set up |
| **Watermark / limits** | None, ever | Watermark and 20 min/mo on the free plan, neither on paid |
| **Setup** | Docker, 8GB+ RAM, model downloads | Sign in and paste a link |
| **MCP / API for agents** | Same `/mcp` endpoint, but only while your machine is on | Always-on endpoint at [mcp.openshorts.app](https://www.openshorts.app/mcp), API keys in one click |
| **Your data** | Your server | Ours |

Self-hosting is genuinely free and always will be. It costs you a machine, your own API keys and the time to keep it running. The hosted plans exist to cover that hardware and those keys, not to unlock features.

## Key Features

### Clip Generator
- **Viral Moment Detection**: Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite analyzes transcripts and scene boundaries to detect 3-15 high-potential moments
- **Runs fully local if you want**: point `LLM_BASE_URL` at Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM or any OpenAI-compatible server and the moment picker runs on your own model, no Google key needed (see [Run without a Google key](#6-run-without-a-google-key-local-llm-optional))
- **Smart 9:16 Cropping**: AI reframing per scene — TRACK mode (MediaPipe + YOLOv8 face tracking), GENERAL mode (blurred background), SPLIT mode (two speakers stacked, captions on the seam) and SCREENCAST mode (screen over presenter); the layout is picked per video by Gemini or forced from the dashboard
- **Auto Subtitles**: faster-whisper with word-level timestamps, styled and burned into clips
- **AI Voice Dubbing**: ElevenLabs integration for 30+ languages with voice cloning
- **Hook Text Overlays**: AI-generated attention-grabbing text overlays
- **AI Video Effects**: Gemini-generated FFmpeg filters for professional effects

## How Much Does It Cost?

Self-hosting OpenShorts is free. You provide the machine and you only pay for the AI APIs you use, and most have generous free tiers:

| Service | Free Tier | Paid Cost | Used For |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Google Gemini** | Free trial with generous limits | < $0.01 per 10-min video | Viral moment detection, script generation, web research |
| **Local LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM...)** | **Free, your hardware** | $0 | Viral moment detection instead of Gemini (`LLM_BASE_URL`) |
| **fal.ai** | Pay-per-use | ~$0.50-1.50 per AI Short | Actor generation, talking head video, lip-sync |
| **ElevenLabs** | Free tier available | Pay-per-use | Voiceover, voice dubbing |
| **Upload-Post** | **10 free uploads/month** to all networks (no credit card) | Pay-per-use | Auto-publishing to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube |
| **AWS S3** | Optional | ~$0.023/GB | Cloud backup for clips and gallery |

**Bottom line:** You can clip videos for practically free with Gemini, and publish 10 videos/month to all social networks at zero cost with Upload-Post.

**Don't want to run any of that?** [openshorts.app](https://www.openshorts.app/) is the same software on our hardware: our NVIDIA GPU clips an 8-minute video in about 50 seconds instead of the 5 to 8 minutes it takes on a typical CPU, the Gemini key is included, and auto-publishing is already wired up. Free plan is 20 minutes a month with a watermark and no credit card; paid plans start at $12/mo for 100 minutes without watermark.

## Requirements

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Google Gemini API Key** ([Free — get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)) — required for all AI features
- **fal.ai API Key** ([Pay-per-use](https://fal.ai)) — required for AI Shorts (actor generation, video, lip-sync)
- **ElevenLabs API Key** ([Free tier](https://elevenlabs.io)) — required for voiceover/dubbing
- **Upload-Post API Key** ([free tier](https://upload-post.com)) — required for direct social posting

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeishansheikh/GetShorts.git
cd GetShorts
```

### 2. Configure (optional)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS keys for S3 backup
```

### 3. Launch
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Open Dashboard
Navigate to **`http://localhost:5175`**

1. Go to **Settings** and enter your API keys (Gemini, fal.ai, ElevenLabs, Upload-Post)
2. **Clip Generator**: Upload a long-form video to generate viral shorts
3. **AI Shorts**: Describe your product or paste a URL to generate UGC marketing videos
4. **YouTube Studio**: Generate thumbnails, titles, and descriptions for YouTube
5. **UGC Gallery**: Browse all generated videos and avatars

### 5. GPU acceleration (optional, NVIDIA)

The default image is CPU-only. With an NVIDIA card (any card with NVENC, e.g. RTX 4060) an 8-minute video clips in about a minute instead of 5 to 8. Nothing is passed through in the VM sense — the container just gets access to the host GPU.

**Host:** install the NVIDIA driver (`nvidia-smi` must work) and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html):
```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi   # sanity check
```
On Windows use Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend and the Windows NVIDIA driver; no driver inside WSL.

**Compose:** create `docker-compose.override.yml` next to `docker-compose.yml` (picked up automatically). `GPU: "1"` adds cuBLAS/cuDNN and onnxruntime-gpu to the image (~2 GB); `video` is required for NVENC.
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        GPU: "1"
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu, video]
```

**`.env`:**
```
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo
WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda
WHISPER_COMPUTE=float16
FFMPEG_ENCODER=auto           # probes h264_nvenc at startup, falls back to x264
TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=parakeet   # optional: ~2x faster than whisper, 25 European languages, auto-falls back to whisper
ASR_GPU_CONCURRENCY=1
```

**Verify:**
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker exec openshorts-backend nvidia-smi -L
docker exec openshorts-backend ffmpeg -hide_banner -f lavfi -i testsrc=size=256x256:rate=1 -frames:v 1 -c:v h264_nvenc -f null -
```
The backend log on the first job reports the chosen encoder and transcription device. A CUDA error in whisper (e.g. VRAM exhausted) retries once on CPU automatically. 8 GB of VRAM is enough for `large-v3-turbo` fp16 plus the detection models.

### 6. Run without a Google key (local LLM, optional)

The only cloud call in the clip pipeline is the moment picker: it sends the
transcript (never the video) to Gemini. Point it at any OpenAI-compatible
server instead and the whole pipeline stays on your box:

```bash
# .env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1   # Ollama on the host
LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5:14b                                # any chat model that follows instructions
# LLM_API_KEY=...                                    # only if your server checks one (vLLM --api-key, OpenRouter)
```

Works with Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp server, LocalAI and OpenRouter.
The dashboard stops asking for a Gemini key when this is set. Two things to
know:

- **Context length.** A scoring call carries three transcript windows
  (~2-3k tokens) and the detail call up to ten (~5k on a long podcast).
  Ollama defaults to a 4096-token context and truncates silently, so run it
  with `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384` (or set `num_ctx` in a Modelfile); raise
  `LLM_SCORE_BATCH` above 3 only if your context allows it. 7-8B models
  return valid JSON reliably, 3B ones do not.
- **What still needs Gemini.** Anything that has to look at frames: the
  automatic layout picker (`AUTO_LAYOUT`), the on-screen content detector
  and silent videos (no speech to clip by). Without a Gemini key those fall
  back to the plain face-tracking crop, and a silent video fails with a
  message that says so. Add a key alongside `LLM_BASE_URL` and you get both.

## Technical Pipeline

### Clip Generator
1. **Ingest** — Local video upload (or self-hosted URL ingest via yt-dlp)
2. **Transcribe** — faster-whisper with word-level timestamps
3. **Detect** — PySceneDetect for scene boundaries
4. **Analyze** — Gemini identifies 3-15 viral moments (15-60s each)
5. **Extract** — FFmpeg precise clip cutting
6. **Reframe** — AI vertical cropping with subject tracking
7. **Effects** — Subtitles, hooks, AI video effects
8. **Publish** — S3 backup + Upload-Post social distribution

### AI Shorts
1. **Analyze** — Website scraping + Gemini web research (or manual description)
2. **Script** — Gemini generates viral scripts with segments
3. **Actor** — Flux 2 Pro portrait generation (or gallery/upload)
4. **Voice** — ElevenLabs TTS voiceover
5. **Video** — Hailuo 2.3 Fast img2video + VEED Lipsync (Low Cost) or Kling Avatar v2 (Premium)
6. **B-roll** — Flux 2 Pro image generation + Ken Burns effect
7. **Composite** — FFmpeg assembly with ASS subtitles and hook overlays
8. **Gallery** — Upload to public S3 with metadata for SEO pages
9. **Publish** — Upload-Post to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube

## Automate It: MCP Server, REST API and Webhooks

You don't need the dashboard. The whole pipeline is callable by AI agents and scripts.

### MCP server (`/mcp`)

OpenShorts ships a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any MCP client can clip and publish videos for you:

**claude.ai and ChatGPT**: paste `https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp` as a custom connector (Settings → Connectors) and approve the access on openshorts.app. The server does OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration, so there is no key to copy; the connection shows up under Account → API keys, where revoking it disconnects the app.

```bash
# Claude Code / Cursor / n8n (hosted): create an API key in your account page
claude mcp add --transport http openshorts https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer osk_..."

# Self-hosted (no key needed, BYOK rules apply):
claude mcp add --transport http openshorts http://localhost:8000/mcp

# Self-hosted without running the web server: same tools over stdio
claude mcp add openshorts -- python mcp_stdio.py
```

Tools: `process_video` (URL or `upload_id`; `captions: false` when the source already has subtitles, `auto_hook: false` to skip the hook line, burned by default like the dashboard), `create_upload` (hand the agent a local file: PUT the bytes, then process), `get_job_status`, `list_clips`, `get_quota`, `add_subtitles`, `recut_clip`, `publish_clip`. A prompt like *"clip this podcast and schedule the best 3 to TikTok"* is now a one-liner in your agent of choice.

### REST API + API keys

Hosted accounts can mint `osk_...` API keys (account page). A key authenticates as you everywhere — same plan, same minutes, same job ownership:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.openshorts.app/api/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer osk_..." -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...", "acknowledged": true,
       "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/hooks/openshorts"}'
```

Interactive docs at `/docs` (OpenAPI) on any instance.

### Completion webhooks

Pass `webhook_url` (and optionally `webhook_secret`) to `POST /api/process` and you get exactly one `POST` when the job reaches a terminal state — no polling loops in your n8n / Zapier / cron pipelines:

```json
{"event": "job.completed", "job_id": "…",
 "clips": [{"index": 0, "title": "…", "video_url": "…", "download_url": "…"}]}
```

With a secret, the body is signed: `X-OpenShorts-Signature: sha256=<hmac-sha256(body)>`.

### CLI

The same API from the terminal, zero dependencies (`cli/`):

```bash
pip install openshorts   # or: uvx openshorts

export OPENSHORTS_API_KEY=osk_...              # hosted
# export OPENSHORTS_API_URL=http://localhost:8000   # self-hosted, no key

openshorts process "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --wait
openshorts clips <job_id>
openshorts publish <job_id> 0 --platforms tiktok,youtube
```

### Agent skill

`skills/openshorts/SKILL.md` follows the open
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard, so it works in any
skill-capable agent:

```bash
# Claude Code (and most agents): copy the folder into the skills directory
cp -r skills/openshorts ~/.claude/skills/

# Hermes Agent: install straight from this repo
hermes skills install mutonby/openshorts/skills/openshorts

# OpenClaw: from ClawHub
openclaw skills install @mutonby/openshorts
```

### n8n

An importable workflow (video URL in, published-ready clips out, no polling)
lives in [`examples/n8n/`](examples/n8n/).
