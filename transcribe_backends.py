"""Transcription backends: NVIDIA Parakeet (onnx-asr) with faster-whisper fallback.

Every caller goes through transcribe_media(), which returns the transcript
contract the whole pipeline depends on:

    {
      "text": str,          # full punctuated transcript
      "language": str,      # whisper-style short code ("es", "en", ...)
      "segments": [
        {"start": float, "end": float, "text": str,
         "words": [{"word": str, "start": float, "end": float}, ...]},
      ],
    }

Invariants the consumers rely on (clip cutting, karaoke subtitles, Remotion):
  - word["word"] carries a LEADING SPACE on true word starts; continuation
    fragments are merged into their base word (merge_continuation_words).
  - all numerics are native Python floats (json.dump of the transcript).
  - words sorted by start, segments chronological, absolute file timestamps.

TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND env: "whisper" (default) | "parakeet".
The parakeet path falls back to whisper automatically when the model errors,
produces no usable words, or the detected language is outside its 25
supported European languages (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Arabic uploads).
GPU whisper in turn falls back to CPU whisper on CUDA errors (VRAM is shared
with other models on the host, so loads can OOM under load).
