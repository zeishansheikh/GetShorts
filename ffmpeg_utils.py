# Loudness normalisation for the delivered clip.
#
# Without this the clip inherits whatever the source was mastered at, so a
# user's clips land anywhere: measured across real delivered clips on
# 26-jul-2026, from -13.8 LUFS on a loud upload down to -28 LUFS on a quiet
# talk. TikTok, Reels and Shorts all normalise playback to roughly -14 LUFS,
# which means the quiet ones just sound thin next to everything else in the
# feed — the loud ones aren't rewarded, the quiet ones are punished.
#
# I=-14 matches the platforms' target, LRA=11 is the usual allowance for speech.
# Applied at the clip cut, where the audio is being encoded to AAC anyway, so it
# costs nothing extra. AUDIO_NORMALIZE=0 turns it off.
#
# TP=-2.0, not the -1.5 that matches the platforms' own advice, because the
# ceiling is enforced BEFORE the AAC encode and the encoder then adds
# inter-sample peaks on top. Measured over 14 corpus clips (31-jul-2026):
#
#   TP=-1.5   peak reached +0.2 dBTP, 1 clip clipping,  8 above -1.0
#   TP=-2.0   peak reached -0.3 dBTP, 0 clipping,       5 above -1.0
#   TP=-3.0   peak reached -0.9 dBTP, 0 clipping,       1 above -1.0
#
# -3.0 also costs level: only 8 of 14 stayed inside -15..-13 LUFS versus 12 at
# -2.0, and level is what the listener notices. Two other fixes were tried and
# do NOT work, so don't reach for them again: an `alimiter` after loudnorm
# (limits sample peaks, not inter-sample, and measured WORSE at +0.7), and
# two-pass loudnorm with linear=true (+0.4, still clipping). The overshoot is
# the codec's, so the only lever is headroom.
